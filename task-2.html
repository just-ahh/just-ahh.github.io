		<p> My audience reflects my narrowed down choice of user. It also makes my choices clearer in what features would be best to use and language.
		The audience would need a clean layout without too many external and distracting features, especially audio and video. But these could be incorporated at a later date if I feel they could enhance user experience and not hinder it.
		Text will need to be to the point, without a lot of rambling. Making sure it is understood by the age range and doesn't come off as condescending is top priority for the information dissemination.

		<h2>Lab Task</h2>
		<p>
		<ol>
		<li> <a href="HRODC.com"> HRODC example website </a> </li>
		<br>
		<ul>
			 <b>Audience</B>
				<li>No idea who it is aimed at, not children but after that no idea. Made for University students but that is from only judging the content. </li>
				<li>The website does have links to social media pages and an email where it is assumed feedback can be given.</li>
				<li>The only experience this project can give is frustration and a headache.</li>  
		
			<b>Affordances</b>
				<li>Website isnâ€™t simple to use. Navigation has been buried at the bottom of the webpage which takes a while to access with how long the page is.</li>
				<li>Cannot tell where you are to go. </li>
				<li>The images are used as buttons and are extremely bright and harsh to look out.</li>
			
			<b>Contrast, Repetition, Alignment and Proximity </b>
				<li>Terrible use of colour and layout.</li>
				<li>No symmetry and balance.  </li>
				<li>Makes the website hard to read and navigate. </li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<li> <a href="Whitehouse.gov"> White house official website </a> </li>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<b>Audience</b>
				<li>Adults, or at least those in teens</li>
				<li>Not limited to those with very good IT skills</li>
				<li>content is appropriate</li>
				
				<b>Affordances, Conceptual Models and Signifiers</b>
				<li>Purpose is to inform people about news in the United States of America, usually political. </li>
				<li>Very easy to use and navigate, clear pathways present. </li>
				<li>Very symmetrical and in proportion.</li>
				<li>Images are used as thumbnails for articles and there is an image carousel also containing links at the top of the page </li>
				<li>All navigation is consistent, same with news stories and other info</li>
				
				<b>Contrast, Repetition, Alignment and Proximity</b>
				<li>Background in white and the text is black, very big contrast, all sections are in blue to distinct different areas</li>
				<li>All navigation is consistent, same with news stories and other info</li>
				
				<b>Content Design</b>
				<li>While not an original problem, still needed to as a trustworthy source for information.</li>
				<li>Very relevant content, you get what you expect of the website.</li>
				<li>Articles are professionally written, and authors and sources can be traced back to their origins.</li>
				<li>Contains many references to other works</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Task 2</h2>
		<p>Still thinking about my intended audience, considering towards adults, workers within
		the museum and cultural heritage sector. If not them then parents and why it is a brilliant mode for learning
		and creation. Therefore, would have to use slightly more sophisticated language but not too complex as to not alienate people who do not have a background in the field. </p>
		<h3> Persona </h3>
		<p>A persona example could be "Susan" who is 42 years old. She has 2 children who are under 10 and wants to know more about how games and video games could help learning.
		She would see the final website as a way to see video games
		in a more educational light and encourage her to take her children to museums with more interactivity to give them more to learn and engage with the content more.</p>

		<h2>Task 3</h2>
		<p> My Website Mood Board</p>
				<div id="picture">
		<img src="images/idea_board.png" alt="My mood board." width="300" height="500">
		</div>
	<p> My mood board is a current guide on how I want my website to look. I have decided on Helvetica for the font and what I think is an okay colour palette.
	It goes between both video game and museum iconography, including the idea of learning because that is the main message of the site.
	I believe the font is accessible and easy to read. With my colour palette chosen for background and also shading to really make some sections pop.
	With my plan to include my own images from research trips to my chosen museums, the imagery will change dependent on what I capture.</p>

		<h2>Independent Learning</h2>
		<p><b>Key words</b></p>
		<ul>
		<li> Games</li>
		<li> Learning</li>
		<li> Museums </li>
		<li> Participation </li>
		<li> Adult & Play / Learning</li>
		
		</ul>
		<p> Some of these terms showed up useable resources, but some more than others.
		Common problem faced was seeing articles and sources talking about museums inside video games, not the other way around.
		<br>
		With my new target audience from the original idea, it is also difficult to find sources on adults and games.
		</p>
		<p>Games and museums returned the most responses that linked to my topic. Participation returned few relevent resources. <br>
		Furthermore, looking at adults & learning/play was beneficial in looking at how adults can benefit from information being presented this way, not just children and young adults.</p>

		<h2>Lab Task </h2>
		<p> Looking at different museums and engagement of children.
			With reasons for family days out, education and a boost to the economy (?), more museums should contain interactive elements. Learning more by interacting instead of just reading 
			a sign or looking at a painting. Beneficial to not just kids, they are optional so do not have to accessed and used to be understood. Gives museums kid friendly places,
			making them more accessible to more people, some exhibits not having any make more quiet calm spaces for those who desire.</p>
			<br>
			<p>To be looking further into the adults and parents of children who play video games and try to market interactivity to them. Parents and adults who don't count themselves as 'gamers' but would still 
			indulge in playing games on their phones such as candy crush and wordscapes. By finding a level of interactivity that suits them and what they want to achieve in terms of learning. <br>
			Making video games in a learning context more accessible for adults, not have them be too difficult or condescending. </p>

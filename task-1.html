		<p> looking at different museums and engagement of children.
			With reasons for family days out, education and a boost to the economy (?), more museums should contain interactive elements. Learning more by interacting instead of just reading 
			a sign or looking at a painting. Beneficial to not just kids, they are optionsal so do not have to accessed and used to be understood. Gives museums kid friendly places,
			making them more accessible to more people, some exhibits not having any make more quiet calm spaces.
